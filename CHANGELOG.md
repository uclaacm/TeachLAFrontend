## Version v1.1.0 | Redirect Loop Fix, Helpful Loading/Error Pages, GitHub Actions! (29/02/2020)

It's our first minor release, exciting! We fixed a redirect loop when the user had empty sketches (introduced in our `Main.js` refactor), add a helpful message when loading takes longer than expected, makes 404/Error pages more helpful and respect themeing, tests out GitHub Actions, and updates lots of dependencies.

Happy new year! This is a quick snapshot of our app at 01/01/20 (wow). The diff from `1.0.0` is just dependency updates. Until I investigate a way to auto-generate these (probably using `gren`, but that didn't work), I'll type them up manually.

## Version 1.0.0 | The Start of Semver (kinda)! (16/12/2019)

Hey there,

This release marks a milestone - the (almost) end of product development for the decade (wow!), and also the official release of our website on the `editor.uclaacm.com` subdomain (with light mode and everything!). It also marks a milestone for our project's maturity; from this point on, we'll adhere to a slightly modified version of semver, where we'll tag releases with bug fixes (patches), new features (minor releases), and changes that dramatically change the structure of our app or involve a changed API (major releases).

Usually, we'll release a PR-based changelog of the diff from the previous version, but in our case that doesn't really make sense for our first release. As we make more releases, we'll add more detail to what's changed!

Keep tuned for more info! Happy holidays, and have a great new year ðŸ˜„!
